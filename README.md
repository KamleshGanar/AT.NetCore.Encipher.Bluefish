This package is compatible with .NetCore 2.2.

# What's in it?
The Bluefish provides the simple functionality to encrypt/decrypt the text. This works on Asymmetric Encryption Method (also called public-key cryptography) and SHA1 is default hash algorithm.
The best thing of this library is that, this is querystring compatible. It means, the excrypted value can be passed as querstring the url and can be easily decrypted at server side.
